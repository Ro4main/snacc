Description: ASN.1 to C or C++ or IDL compiler
 Snacc is short for "Sample Neufeld ASN.1 to C Compiler" and ASN.1
 stands for Abstract Syntax Notation One (ITU-T X.208/ISO 8824).
 Snacc supports a subset of ASN.1 1988.  If you need features of
 ASN.1 1992 or later, snacc is not for you.
 .
 Given an ASN.1 source file(s) snacc can produce:
 .
 1. C routines for BER encoding, decoding, printing and freeing.
 2. C++ routines for BER encoding, decoding, and printing.
 3. A type table that can be used with C driver routines
    for BER encoding, decoding, printing and freeing.
 .
 If you want to build snacc based applications, you want to install
 the libsnacc-dev package, too.  Your application will then depend on
 the snacc libraries, you find in the libsnacc0c2 package.
